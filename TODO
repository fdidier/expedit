- Bug: file permission

- clean utf8 support (same code at many places)
- use tools for dos/unix file type, encoding conversion ?
- clean prev_search ?
- save screen_pos in jump_pos ?
- begin/end change lines ? (cool except if I want full macro... )
- save screen pos as well in info file
- full macro

- arrange text highlight
- screen/mouse integration with main
