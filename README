The program may not work on all terminals.
It uses xclip for X selection support.
Syntax highlight is not language dependant and isn't perfect.

Commands:

^Q Quit
^S Save
^Z Undo
^Y Redo

^R Repeat last inline edit (only deletion + added chars on the same line without cursors move).
^T repeat Till current line/occurence (useful for replace with ^L).

^A (begin) begin of line.
^E (end) end of line.

^L goto given Line number (empty = last one, ^L again = begin).
   It also display the current position while waiting for numbers.
   You can also use line:position or :position format and negative line will
   count from the end of the file, so ^L-1^M will go to the last line.
   Note that 0 will also go there.

^D (del) del character under cursor
^H (backspace) del character before cursor
^K Kill to end of line.
^B kill to Begin of line.
^W kill Word before

^C Copy line(s) -- It advances to the beginning of next line.
^X cut line(s) -- It advances to the beginning of next line.
^V paste at cursor position the text grabbed by the last(s) ^C or ^X.
   If ^V just follow a series of ^X, then the previous selection is used.
   This is useful for replacing lines.

^F Find : enter search pattern (previous one if left empty).
^G search aGain (same as ^F with empty pattern).
^U search first (current or id under cursor), go Up.
^N search Next (current or id under cursor).
^P search Previous (current or id under cursor).

^\ jump to previous interesting cursor position.

^J Justify (uses a few heuristics, useful for // comments).
^I (tab) Indent if only space before or complete (super useful).

^M (enter)
^O Open line before.

(insert) Insert next keystroke.


// Doubtfull commands.
^] change case and avance right (useful?).
^[ (esc) cancel current command (useful?).
^_ ??
^^ ??

(arrow keys) move around
(pgup) move by an half screen up
(pgdown) move by an half screen down
(shift/ctrl + lr arrow keys) forward/backward word
(shift/ctrl + ud arrow keys) pgup/pgdown.


Mouse:

wheel: scroll view.
left click: move cursor on text, select line on line number.
left click + move : select.
left click on cursor position (i.e. double left click): select word.
middle/right click : paste.

Toggles:

F1  line number (+redraw)
F2  auto indent

Notes:

fe store a file last state (previous save) in .fe/file
fe store last files position in .fe/info
fe store last selection in ~/.fe/selection

Uppon execution, selection is read, and if the file appear in info, the cursor
and screen position are the same as last time.

What is different?

- When changin line, the cursor base position do not behave like in the other
editors. This allow for easy "block" editing.

- The repeat/till mechanism is very powerful (but probably not polished
  enough). Doing replaces with ^N^R is really quick and nice.
